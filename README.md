# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a Python program for pattern detection and implementing a Three in a Row game. The program is designed to be connected to a Raspberry Pi with an attached RPI camera. The provided files and documentation offer insights into the calibration process, pattern filtering, and potential future enhancements.

## Files:

1. **Calibration.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the calibration process for the camera, yielding essential parameters for the program.

2. **Práctica Final Visión por Ordenador.pdf**: A comprehensive PDF document explaining the code's functions, showcasing frames for demonstration, and presenting the results obtained.

3. **Practica_Final_Jorge_Gomez_Azor_Carlos_Mazuecos_Reillo_RGB.py**: The primary Python code for executing the program. More precise.

4. **Practica_Final_Jorge_Gomez_Azor_Carlos_Mazuecos_Reillo_BGR.py**: A second version of the program, which may be less precise and more dependent on lighting conditions.

5. **Demonstration.mp4**: A video providing a visual demonstration of the program's functionality.

Feel free to explore the provided files and documentation for a detailed understanding of the calibration, pattern detection, and game implementation process. The PDF document offers in-depth explanations, visual demonstrations, and potential areas for future development.
