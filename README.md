# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a Python program for pattern detection and implement a Tic-Tac-Toe game. The program is designed to be connected to a Raspberry Pi with an attached RPI camera. The provided files and documentation provide insights into the calibration process, pattern filtering, and potential future enhancements.

## Execution of the program:

1. Place calibration images of a chessboard with dimensions 11x12 in the calibration folder, similar to the ones provided. These images should be captured with your camera.

2. Run 'camera_calibration.ipynb' to calibrate the camera and ensure correct calibration parameters.

3. Execute 'Practica_Final_Jorge_Gomez_Azor_Carlos_Mazuecos_Reillo.py' and follow the program's instructions. For any uncertainties regarding the program's functionality, refer to the 'Demonstration.mp4' video.

## Files:

1. **camera_calibration.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook guides you through the camera calibration process and provides the camera parameters.

2. **Explicacion_Practica_Final.pdf**: A detailed PDF document explaining the code's functions, showcasing frames for demonstration, and presenting the obtained results.

3. **Practica_Final_Jorge_Gomez_Azor_Carlos_Mazuecos_Reillo.py**: The primary Python code for running the program. More precise and reliable.

4. **Practica_Final_Jorge_Gomez_Azor_Carlos_Mazuecos_Reillo_BGR.py**: A second version of the program, which may be less precise and more dependent on lighting conditions. This version is located in the 'future_implementations' folder.

5. **demostracion.mp4**: A video providing a visual demonstration of the program's functionality.

6. **Calibration folder**: Place images of the chessboard captured with your camera in this folder for calibration.

Feel free to explore the provided files and documentation for a detailed understanding of the calibration, pattern detection, and game implementation process. The PDF document offers in-depth explanations, visual demonstrations, and potential areas for future development.
